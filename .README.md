# ldpc
This module provides a suite of tools for building and benmarking low density parity check (LDPC) codes. Features include functions for mod2 (binary) arithmatic and a fast implementation of the belief propagation decoder.

## Installation from PyPi

Installtion from PyPi requires Python>=3.6.
To install via pip, run:

```
pip install ldpc
```

## Installation (from source)

Installation from sources requires Python>=3.6 and a local C compiler (eg. 'gcc' in Linux or 'clang' in Windows). Once these requirements have been met, navigate to the repository root and install using pip:

```
pip install -e ldpc
```

## Basic usage

In this package error correction codes are represented in terms of their parity check matrix. The parity check matrix for the repetition code can be loaded as follows:

```python
from ldpc.codes import rep_code
length=5 #specify the lenth of the repetion code
pcm=rep_code(length)
```

## Demo Scripts

A demo simulation script can be found in the examples folder.
